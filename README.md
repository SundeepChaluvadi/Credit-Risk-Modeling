# Credit Risk Modeling
A machine learning project that predicts a borrowerâ€™s likelihood of loan default for data science and finance applications.

## Business Problem
Financial institutions need to assess the likelihood of loan applicants defaulting to minimize losses and make informed lending decisions. This project builds a machine learning model that predicts whether a borrower is a good or bad credit risk, helping banks make data-driven lending decisions and reduce credit risk.

## Data Preprocessing
#### Handling Missing Values
Checked the dataset for missing values and removed rows with missing data to ensure a clean dataset for modeling.

## Data Visualization
#### Distributions of Sex, Job, Housing, Saving accounts, Checking account, Purpose
